# Programming Language Paradigms - CMPSCI 287

_[This section was reconstructed from a badly damaged original - Stephen Leach, July 2024]_

The material for this course is being adapted for use with a web-browser, so that only a small number of lectures are available in this form.

The S97 version of the course is available on-line via the UMASS Scheme system, which requires an X-Windows system to view it with full facilities.The text of the lecture notes is to be found in on the Edlab machines at:
