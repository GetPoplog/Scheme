The VED editor, built into UMASS Scheme, can be used remotely in two ways.

(1) You can use it from a machine equipped with an X-server.

(2) You can use it from a machine equipped with a modem + terminal emulator.

Using VED from a machine with an X-server
-----------------------------------------
All you need do is the Unix command

    setenv DISPLAY  <mymachine>

This tells UMASS Scheme to use <mymachine>  (e.g. roo.cs.umass.edu) as the
machine on which to display X-windows widgets, menus etc.. Thus you should
have much the same environment as you have in the EDLAB.

This capability may be available for PC's running the Linux operating system,
and there is also Macintosh software which supports X-windows. OIT offer PPP
accounts, which, for an extra fee will allow you to use X on your own machine.

More help on this subject is now available.

The Marked Range
----------------
As well as being able to select text by dragging the mouse, it is also
possible to mark a _____range of text. This is a number of complete lines, and is
indicated by a vertical bar that appears at the left of the screen.

Under X windows, you can mark a range by pressing the control key
(labelled Ctrl on the left of the keyboard) and dragging the mouse with the
left button held down.

Sending Mail
------------
There are two commands in VED to send mail. The first is  <enter> send
which sends a complete file. The second is <enter> sendmr which sends the
marked range. In either case the text to be sent should begin with

To: <name>

where <name> is the email address of the desired recipient. Thus

Receiving Mail
--------------
You can receive mail in Scheme by doing <enter> mail. This will append all
your new mail messages to a file called mymail, which will be presented to you
in a VED buffer. You may love or hate this way of reading mail. Note that the
mail, once read, is not available to other mailers.

Using VED from a terminal emulator
----------------------------------
I have set up VED with a partial emulation of the EMACS editor for this
use by the class. A VT100 emulator is needed (this is the most common
capability) You may need to do:

  setenv term vt100

before you call scheme so that the editor will believe it can use your
terminal.

  Calling VED from Scheme
--------------------------
To edit a file type

    (edit <file>)

where <file> is a string. For example (edit "fred.scm") will edit the file
"fred.scm".  The function call (ved <file>) can also be used.

To start up VED with a default file, just type (edit).

  Control Characters.
---------------------
A control character is obtained by holding  down the Ctrl key (usually on  the
lower left of  a keyboard) and  then pressing another  character. For  example
control-A (usually written ctrl-A)  is obtained by holding  down the Ctrl  key
and then pressing A. Note that ^D will cause exit from your top level window.

The control keys have the following effects:

^A  Move to beginning of line
^B  Move back one character
^C  Exit from UMASS Scheme (This words ONLY in the VED editor)
^D  Delete next character
^E  Move to end of line
^F  Move forward one character
^G  Interrupt the current computation.
^H  [Reserved]
^I  Insert a tabulation character or equivalent spaces.
^J  Go to start of next line
^K  Delete to end of line
^L  Redraw current page.
^M  Insert a newline character.
^N  Move down 1 line.
^O  Open up a line for typing.
^P  Move back 1 line.
^Q  Quote a character (may not work depending on your comms. line).
^R  Search backward
^S  Search forward (this may not work on your comms line, so do <esc> s.)
^T  Transpose 2 previous character.
^U-n Insert n copies of next letter typed.
^W   Delete from where mark was set. (See <esc>-@)
^X   Used in various combinations.
^Y   "Yank" back deleted text, usually to another place.
^Z   Suspend current process.

  Escape sequences.
-------------------
The escape key is F11 on Decstations. Most other keyboards have a separate
escape key. To send an escape sequence, press the escape key and then press
the other key.

<esc> @  Mark beginning of range.
<esc> x  Move cursor to "command line" at top of window, This is an
         alternative for  the enter key if you don't have one, or have one
         that has the same effect as <return>
<esc> s  Start a forward search - type the string to be searched for
         after the "/" that appears on the command line.

  ^X Sequences
--------------
 ^X-^S   Save the file being worked on
 ^X-^W   Write the current buffer into a file with a different name
 ^X-^M   Write out all modified files
 ^X-Q or
 ^X-^Q   Quit the current file with an option to write it (same as ^X-d)
 ESC-^X  Write and compile all program files, then exit to POP
 ^C      ( or ESC-^C or ^X-^C)    Finish by exiting to the shell or DCL
 ^_      Recursively push (escape) to a new shell (spawn new shell)
^X-o     Go to previous window.
^X-1     Expand current window to fill whole terminal
^X-b     List buffers now in VED.
^X-^E    Load the current function.
^X-f     Mark start of range.
^X-l     Mark end of range.

  <enter> command sequences
----------------------------
The <enter> key, found on the extreme bottom right of most keyboards, allows
you to type certain commands to ved. The sequence <esc> x also has this
effect.

<enter> l1      Load the current file
<enter> lmr     Load the marked range
<enter> lcp     Load the current function
<enter> q       Quit from the current file.
<enter> dired   See <enter> help dired for an explanation of this useful
                directory-listing capability.

Changing your default font for VED under X.
-------------------------------------------
If you want to use a different font, add a line of the form XVed*font: <font>
to your .Xdefaults file. You can obtain a (long) listing of available fonts
by doing xlsfonts as a Unix command.  You can also change the font of a
particular window by doing <enter> window font <font>.

XVed*font: 7x12    # The default size - rather small for some peole
XVed*font: 9x15    # A bigger size, which you may like better.
