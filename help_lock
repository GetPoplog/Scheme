UMASS Scheme puts a lock on a file  as you open it it in a Scheme  process.
If any other Scheme process tries to access this file, it will only be able
to have read access to it. This means  that you can only look at the  file,
change the buffer, but NOT write it to the file-store.

Files are locked by creating  another null file whose  name is the same  as
that of the original file with ".VLCK" appended. Occasionally, if a  Scheme
process exits abnormally, you will have to  use the Unix command rm to  get
rid of the file lock.

Generally, you should NOT have several UMASS Scheme processes running.
