This directory contains the source of UMASS Scheme together with  .psv
files for decstations and alphas. Suitable make scripts are provided.
Note that the make process checks out the .psv file by running a
lot of scheme examples past it.

In UMASS we provide a .cshrc script which starts up POP-11 with
the appropriate .psv file depending on which machine the user
is logged in on.

This implementation of Scheme is tailored to the UMASS course on
"Programming Paradigms", so it does leave out certain Scheme
features not required for that class, and adds certain features
(notable opaque records using the record-class facility of POP-11,
and the use of updaters) which are not standard Scheme.

It is intended for use under X-windows. The file menubar_scm.p
specifies how each window appears.

Documentation is written in HTML, and is available to Scheme using
a browser that I cobbled up.

Robin.
